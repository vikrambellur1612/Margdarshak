    <h1>KCET & Karnataka Engineering Admission: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
    <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">1. What is KCET?</div>
        <div class="answer">KCET (Karnataka Common Entrance Test) is the entrance exam conducted by the Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) for admission to engineering, pharmacy, architecture, and several other courses in Karnataka's state and private colleges.</div>
        <div class="question">2. Who is eligible for KCET? What documents do I need?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <strong>Eligibility Criteria for Karnataka CET:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Student should have studied in Karnataka school (any board – state/CBSE/ICSE) for minimum 7 years (complete academic years and not mid-term of a particular year out of the 7 years)</li>
                <li>Of these 7 years (or more) – at least one of the year should be either in 10th or 12th</li>
                <li>Must have passed 12th/2nd PUC with Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics (PCM) or (PCB for some courses)</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Examples to know if you are eligible or not for KCET:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>NOT Eligible:</strong> A student has studied for 9 years from 1st standard till 9th standard and moved to a different state from 10th to 12th standard – NOT Eligible for KCET – as student has not done one of the board exams of 10th or 12th from Karnataka</li>
                <li><strong>Eligible:</strong> A student has studied from 1st standard to 6th standard (full year) in Karnataka. Then 7th to 11th standard in some other state. Again the student has studied 12th in Karnataka – Eligible for KCET and it meets both the above mentioned criteria (minimum 7 years + one of the board exams in Karnataka)</li>
                <li><strong>NOT Eligible:</strong> A student has studied from LKG to 6th standard in Karnataka and 7th onwards in a different state – NOT eligible for KCET as the academic years are considered only between 1st standard and 12th standard, out of which one need to have studied at least 7 years in Karnataka</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Required Documents:</strong>
            <p>To prove that you have studied in Karnataka for at least 7 years and completed either 10th or 12th in Karnataka, KEA has started using SATS (Students Achievement Tracking System) to pull the data automatically for your ward. The SATS (or sometimes referred to as STS ID) should be part of TC which your school would have issued. Otherwise, you need to contact the school and get the ID. There can be more than one SATS ID also (when kids changed school, the new school would have created a new SATS ID) which is acceptable by KCET.</p>
            <p>In some cases, where SATS entry is not available for your kid for some years which they have studied in Karnataka, you need to get study certificate from school (in the format which KEA has mandated). Please note that the KEA has a specific format with name, year(s) of study, board, mother tongue etc which should be mentioned in study certificate. Hence any other document like TC cannot be used as study certificate.</p>
            <p>If a student has studied from 1st standard to 4th standard in one school in Karnataka, then from 5th to 10th is another school and 11th/12th in a different college/school – then you need to go to each of those schools and get study certificate for the duration of student's study in that school/board. If any of these schools belong to state board, then you need to go to BEO office corresponding to the school (you check with respective school) and get the study certificate attested from BEO (block education officer). KEA/KCET don't expect CBSE/ICSE study certificates to be attested though.</p>
            <p><strong>Non-Karnataka students can only apply through COMEDK.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">3. How is the KCET rank calculated?</div>
        <div class="answer">The final rank is based on 50% of the KCET exam marks (PCM subjects) and 50% of the qualifying board exam marks (PCM).</div>
        <div class="question">4. Are CBSE/ICSE/Other Board marks accepted for KCET ranking?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, the PCM marks from any recognized board (CBSE, ICSE, Cambridge, State Board, etc.) are considered for calculating the 50% board weightage.</div>
        <div class="question">5. Is biology required for BTech Biotechnology?</div>
        <div class="answer">Most BTech Biotechnology programs in Karnataka require only PCM for eligibility, similar to other engineering branches. For pure science degrees (like BS/MS in IISc), biology might be needed. Always check the specific college's requirements.</div>
        <div class="question">6. What are the required documents for KCET registration and counseling?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>SSLC/10th marks card (for proof of age and education)</li>
                <li>12th/PUC marks card</li>
                <li>Study certificate (from classes 1–12, especially 7 years in Karnataka)</li>
                <li>Caste/category certificate (if claiming reservation)</li>
                <li>Domicile/Residence certificate (if needed)</li>
                <li>SATS DB (Student Achievement Tracking System – for students in Karnataka state schools)</li>
                <li>Recent passport-size photos and photo ID proof</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="question">7. What is SATS DB or SATS Id? Why is it important?</div>
        <div class="answer">SATS (Student Achievement Tracking System) is a database of all Karnataka state students. Students from Karnataka state schools must provide their unique SATS ID for admissions, document verification, and tracking.</div>
        <div class="question">8. What if my board marks and name spelling differ across documents?</div>
        <div class="answer">Name, date of birth, and other personal details must match across all major documents (Aadhaar, board marks cards, study certificates). Discrepancies must be rectified before document verification; a legal affidavit or correction certificate may be required.</div>
        <div class="question">9. Do foreign/OCI students qualify for KCET?</div>
        <div class="answer">Typically, only Indian citizens or those who have valid 7-year study certificates in Karnataka (including a board exam year) can apply for KCET. Some OCI students have been allowed if they meet domicile/study requirements.</div>
        <div class="question">10. What is STS or Study Certificate? How is it obtained?</div>
        <div class="answer">The Study Certificate proves the student has studied for the required number of years (at least 7) in Karnataka. It is issued by the school principal/head, often on a standard format prescribed by KEA.</div>
        <div class="question">11. What if I studied some years in Karnataka, but not all?</div>
        <div class="answer">Only students who complete 7 years (including 10th/12th) in Karnataka are eligible for state quota through KCET. Others should apply using COMEDK/all-India or management quotas.</div>
        <div class="question">12. Is there negative marking in KCET?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, there is no negative marking in KCET.</div>
        <div class="question">13. How many times can I attempt KCET?</div>
        <div class="answer">You can attempt KCET multiple times, but only during your class 12th year or the year you complete 12th/2nd PUC.</div>
        <div class="question">14. When is KCET conducted and when is the application deadline?</div>
