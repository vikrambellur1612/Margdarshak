        <div class="question">What is PES University and how is it different from other private colleges?</div>
        <div class="answer">PES University (PESU) is one of the most sought-after private engineering colleges in Karnataka, typically grouped with RVCE, BMS, and MSRIT as top-tier institutions. It's often compared to VIT Vellore and MIT Manipal nationally. PES has never participated in COMEDK counseling and conducts its own admission process.</div>
        <div class="question">What are the different campuses of PES University?</div>
        <div class="answer">PES has two main campuses:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ring Road (RR) Campus:</strong> The original and flagship campus, historically preferred by students with higher ranks</li>
            <li><strong>Electronic City (EC) Campus:</strong> Newer campus with same faculty and curriculum as RR campus</li>
        </ul>
        Both campuses belong to the same university (PESU) with shared faculty, same syllabus, and joint placement activities.</div>
        <div class="question">What are the admission routes for PES University?</div>
        <div class="answer">PES has three main admission categories:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>KCET Quota (40% seats):</strong> Through KEA counseling, fees ~‚Çπ1.25L per annum</li>
            <li><strong>PES Counseling (45% seats):</strong> Through PES's own counseling based on JEE Main scores / KCET rank - fees ‚Çπ4-5L per annum</li>
            <li><strong>Management Quota (15% seats):</strong> Direct admission with higher fees</li>
        </ul></div>
        <div class="question">Has PESSAT been discontinued?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, PES discontinued PESSAT from 2025. They now admit students based on JEE Main scores, KCET ranks, and COMEDK scores through their own counseling process. This change was made to attract students from across India rather than just Bangalore-based students.</div>
        <div class="question">How does PES admission work through JEE quota?</div>
        <div class="answer">Students must register on the PES website (registration fee ‚Çπ1200). PES conducts its own counseling based on JEE Main ranks - they DO NOT participate in JOSAA counseling. About 45% of seats are filled through this route with fees ranging from ‚Çπ4-5L per annum.</div>
        <div class="question">Can KCET students apply for both quotas in PES?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, KCET students have two options:
        <ul>
            <li>Apply through KEA counseling (no PES registration needed) - fees ‚Çπ1.25L per annum</li>
            <li>Register with PES for their counseling using KCET rank - fees ‚Çπ4-5L per annum</li>
        </ul>
        About 10% of the JEE quota seats may be allotted to KCET/COMEDK rank holders who register with PES.</div>
        <div class="question">What happens if I get a seat through both PES counseling and KEA counseling?</div>
        <div class="answer">If you secure a seat through PES counseling (higher fee) and later get the same specialization and campus through KEA counseling (lower fee), PES will refund the difference amount. You can then continue with the lower fee structure.</div>
        <div class="question">When does PES counseling happen?</div>
        <div class="answer">PES typically conducts their first round of counseling around May (before JOSAA counseling), with subsequent rounds aligning with KCET counseling timeline. The exact dates are announced after JEE Main results.</div>
        <div class="question">What are the typical JEE cutoffs for PES?</div>
        <div class="answer">While PES doesn't publish official cutoffs, based on parent experiences:
        <ul>
            <li>Computer Science (RR Campus): JEE Main rank around 8,000-12,000</li>
            <li>Computer Science (EC Campus): JEE Main rank around 15,000-20,000</li>
            <li>Other branches: Varies based on demand and supply</li>
        </ul>
        The actual cutoff depends on the number of applicants and their willingness to pay the higher fees.</div>
        <div class="question">How are placements at PES University?</div>
        <div class="answer">PES has a strong placement record:
        <ul>
            <li>Percentage-wise placement is better than VIT due to smaller intake</li>
            <li>Good placement opportunities in IT companies</li>
            <li>Average packages competitive with other top private colleges</li>

        </ul>
        However, like all colleges, placements can be affected by industry conditions.</div>
        <div class="question">Which campus is better - Ring Road or Electronic City?</div>
        <div class="answer">Both campuses have the same faculty, curriculum, and belong to PESU. However:
        <ul>
            <li>RR Campus is the original campus with established legacy</li>
            <li>Higher rankers typically prefer RR campus during counseling</li>
            <li>EC Campus is newer but equally equipped</li>
            <li>Academic quality and placements are comparable</li>
        </ul>
        Choice often depends on personal preference and availability.</div>
        <div class="question">What documents are needed for PES registration?</div>
        <div class="answer">Basic documents typically include:

        <div class="question">How does PES compare to other colleges like VIT, RVCE, BMS?</div>
        <div class="answer">PES is typically grouped with RVCE, BMS, and MSRIT as top private colleges in Bangalore. Key points:
        <ul>
            <li>More diverse student population due to no state quota</li>
            <li>Smaller intake compared to VIT, leading to better percentage placement</li>
            <li>Strong industry connections and research partnerships</li>
            <li>Located in Bangalore, providing better internship and job opportunities</li>
            <li>Fees are higher than government quota seats but comparable to other private colleges</li>
        </ul></div>
        <div class="question">Is it too early to register for PES in October?</div>
        <div class="answer">It's not too early as PES allows early registration. The final admission is based on merit (JEE/KCET scores) and not on registration date. However, ensure you keep your registration details updated once exam scores are available.</div>
        <div class="question">What are the additional fees apart from tuition?</div>
        <div class="answer">Apart from the tuition fees, students typically pay:
        <ul>
            <li>Registration fee: ‚Çπ1200 (for JEE quota)</li>
            <li>Additional college fees: ‚Çπ25,000-50,000 (as reported by parents)</li>
            <li>Hostel fees: Separate charges if opting for accommodation</li>
        </ul>
        Total cost can vary based on the quota and additional services chosen.</div>
        <div class="question">Can I change my branch or campus after admission?</div>
        <div class="answer">PES allows sliding to a more preferred specialization/campus if you become eligible in subsequent counseling rounds based on your JEE/KCET scores. However, this is subject to seat availability and their counseling rules.</div>
