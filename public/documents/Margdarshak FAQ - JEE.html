<h2>Practical Tips and Application Issues (Asked by Real Parents)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Always keep Aadhaar updated: photo, DoB, name as per 10th/12th records.</li>
<li>Have at least 15‚Äì20 recent passport photos on hand for various applications.</li>
<li>Keep scanned versions of photo/signature ready as per form specs (size, background).</li>
<li>If facing errors in online forms (uploads, OTP, Digilocker, site not loading), try off-hours or wait a few days‚Äîdon‚Äôt panic.</li>
<li>Register with actual candidate‚Äôs mobile and email where comfortable; otherwise, parent‚Äôs phone/email OK but be alert for all messages/OTPs.</li>
<li>For all national exams, state domicile/study certificate generally not required‚Äîdon‚Äôt chase unnecessary paperwork.</li>
<li>Read all form instructions and check for latest version/revisions each year‚Äîprocesses change frequently!</li>
</ul>
<div class="adm-advice">
<b>Group consensus:</b> Don‚Äôt rush to fill forms on day one‚Äîportals are busiest and buggiest then. Track deadlines, but submit when servers are stable.
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-section">
<h2>Books, Practice Tests, Preparation Material (From Chat Consensus)</h2>
<ul>
<li>JEE Mains PYQ: <span class="chat-highlight">Disha PYQ books</span> recommended by many parents</li>
<li>Online timed tests: <span class="chat-highlight">Unacademy, Allen DLP</span>; Allen has AI-based test series with some computer-based test (CBT) centers</li>
<li>For KCET/COMEDK: <span class="chat-highlight">Navakarnataka, Base books (if you get from alumni/old students)</span></li>
<li>For chapterwise, timed practice: Unacademy, Aakash, and FIITJEE portals mentioned</li>
<li>‚ÄúStar/save‚Äù key admin FAQ posts in your WhatsApp to avoid losing useful shared PDFs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="faq-section">
<h2>JosAA and State Counselling ‚Äì Key Parent/Admin Clarifications</h2>
<div class="question">Can I take part in both JoSAA and state (KCET/MH CET/TNEA) counselling?</div>
<div class="answer">Yes, if eligible. Many do both, and choose the better seat/branch/fee at the end.</div>
<div class="question">State application deadlines and JoSAA rounds may overlap‚Äîis it a problem?</div>
<div class="answer">Usually, JoSAA rounds finish before most state rounds begin. Parents advise tracking both and not locking in admission until you‚Äôre satisfied.</div>
<div class="question">What is the typical home‚Äìstate rule for state exams?</div>
<div class="answer">Each state has own rules but almost all use ‚Äúminimum years of schooling‚Äù and ‚Äúplace of 10th or 12th‚Äù as key home quota criteria‚Äînot parent‚Äôs native or Aadhaar address. Confirm latest rule in that year‚Äôs information bulletin.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-section">
<h2>Other Frequent Parent/Student Issues (From Group)</h2>
<ul>
<li>If twins, siblings applying: best to use <u>different</u> mobile numbers to avoid Digilocker/portal mapping trouble.</li>
<li>If moving states often (transferable jobs): focus on national-level exams (JEE/BITSAT/VITEEE/IIIT) and COMEDK, which don‚Äôt have domicile restrictions.</li>
<li>Is coaching (Allen, FIITJEE, Aakash, Unacademy) a must? ‚Äì No, but useful for mock tests and discipline; many succeed with self-study plus good books.
</li>
<li>For registration: late applicants can get city centers ‚Äúfarther away‚Äù for the national exams‚Äîregister early if home city is crucial.</li>
</ul>
