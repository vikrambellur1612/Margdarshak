    <div class="document-content">
        <p>PES University (PESU) <h3 class="faq-question" id="q1">1. What major changes has PES made for admissions?</h3> PES has discontinued PESSAT and now considers JEE/KCET/COMEDK scores for admissions. The college maintains two admission channels:  • 40% seats through KCET counseling (fees around ₹<h3 class="faq-question" id="q1">1. 25L per annum via KEA)  • 45% seats through their own counseling based on JEE/KCET/COMEDK ranks (fees ₹4-5L per annum) 2. How does PES counseling work?</h3> PES conducts its own counseling process separate from centralized counseling:  • Round-1 typically happens before KCET/COMEDK counseling  • Full fee payment required on counseling day with physical presence  • Round-2 happens after other counseling processes  • Interestingly, Round-2 cutoXs can sometimes be higher than Round-1 due to demand-supply dynamics <h3 class="faq-question" id="q3">3. What are the fee adjustment policies at PES?</h3>  • Students who secure PES seats through higher-fee counseling but later get KCET seats can get fee adjustments  • Full refund policies follow UGC guidelines with time-based deductions  • Withdrawal before Round-2 counseling typically allowed with minimal deduction (around ₹10K) RV College Ecosystem <h3 class="faq-question" id="q4">4. What are the diAerent RV institutions in Bangalore?</h3> There are three distinct RV institutions, often confused but completely separate: RVCE (RV College of Engineering)  • Established: 1963 (original and most reputed)  • Type: Autonomous college aXiliated to VTU</p>

<li>Admission: Through KCET/COMEDK/Management seats only  • Courses: All major engineering streams (CS, ECE, Electrical, Mechanical, Biotech, etc.)  • Status: Top-tier college in Bangalore, grouped with PES/BMS/MSRIT RV University (RVU)  • Established: 2022  • Type: Independent university  • Admission: Through KCET and JEE scores (no longer RVSAT)  • Courses: Only BTech Computer Science (Hons)  • Fees: ₹<h3 class="faq-question" id="q5">5. 6L per annum (JEE route), ₹9.6L per annum (management)  • Seats: 540 total seats with 45% through KCET RVITM (RV Institute of Technology)  • Established: 2019  • Type: College under VTU (not autonomous)  • Admission: Through KCET/COMEDK/Management seats  • Status: Still developing reputation, can be grouped with other VTU colleges 5. Are placements common across RV institutions?</h3>  • RVCE allows RVITM (and possibly RVU) students to participate in their placement drives  • However, success depends on individual performance in interviews  • RVCE students typically have advantage due to better preparation and internship opportunities  Similar to RVCE/RVU/RVITM, other colleges like Dayanand Sagar has DSCE/DSU/DSATM and MSRIT has RUAS. Understand the diXerence between diXerent colleges and then choose the options wisely.</li>
