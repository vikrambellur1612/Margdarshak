# 🔧 Service Worker Iframe Fix

## Problem Identified
- **Error**: "FetchEvent resulted in a network error response: a redirected response was used for a request whose redirect mode is not 'follow'"
- **Root Cause**: Service Worker was intercepting iframe requests for documents and trying to apply caching strategies, but iframe navigation has different redirect requirements
- **Impact**: Documents were still loading (showing "Document loaded successfully") but generating console errors

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Bypass Iframe Requests**
Updated the Service Worker to completely skip iframe and document navigation requests:

```javascript
// Skip iframe and document navigation requests entirely
if (request.destination === 'iframe' || 
    request.destination === 'document' ||
    request.mode === 'navigate' ||
    url.pathname.includes('/documents/')) {
  return; // Let the browser handle these requests directly
}
```

### 2. **Simplified Caching Strategy**
- **Only cache app files** (JS, CSS, icons, manifest)
- **Let browser handle documents directly** (no Service Worker interference)
- **Removed document-specific caching** to avoid redirect mode conflicts

### 3. **Fixed Fetch Options**
Enhanced remaining fetch strategies with proper redirect mode:

```javascript
const fetchRequest = new Request(request.url, {
  method: request.method,
  headers: request.headers,
  body: request.body,
  mode: 'cors',
  credentials: 'same-origin',
  redirect: 'follow'  // Explicit redirect handling
});
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

After deployment:
- ✅ **No more console errors** about redirect mode
- ✅ **Documents load normally** in iframes
- ✅ **PWA functionality preserved** (install, offline for app shell)
- ✅ **Better performance** (less Service Worker overhead for documents)

## 📋 Technical Details

### What Changed:
1. **Service Worker scope reduced** - only handles app assets
2. **Iframe requests bypassed** - no Service Worker interference
3. **Document requests bypassed** - direct browser handling
4. **Redirect mode fixed** - proper 'follow' mode for remaining requests

### What's Preserved:
- ✅ PWA installation capability
- ✅ App shell caching (main page, CSS, JS, icons)
- ✅ Offline functionality for the main app
- ✅ Background sync and notifications

### What's Simplified:
- ❌ Document caching (documents load fresh each time)
- ❌ Complex caching strategies for documents
- ❌ Service Worker management of iframe content

## 🔍 Why This Approach?

1. **Compatibility**: Avoids redirect mode conflicts with iframe navigation
2. **Simplicity**: Focuses Service Worker on what it does best (app shell)
3. **Reliability**: Documents always load fresh from server
4. **Performance**: Less overhead, fewer potential conflicts

## 🚀 Deployment Impact

- **Low risk** - only reduces Service Worker scope
- **Immediate benefit** - eliminates console errors
- **Better UX** - cleaner, error-free browsing experience
- **Maintained functionality** - all features work as before
