<h1>COMEDK Engineering Admissions – Extensive FAQ</h1>
    <p><em>Based on in-group chat discussions only • Last updated Jan 2025</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>What is COMEDK and how is it different from KCET?</strong><br>
             COMEDK is an all-India entrance test (no domicile restriction) for private engineering colleges in Karnataka; KCET is for Karnataka residents only (7 years of study in Karnataka, with 10th or 12th there). KCET rank = 50% board PCM marks + 50% KCET exam; COMEDK uses only exam performance for ranking. Fees: KCET ~₹1.2L/yr; COMEDK ~₹3L/yr.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Who can apply for COMEDK?</strong><br>
            Anyone with Indian nationality, including NRI/OCI, who has passed (or is appearing in) 12th grade (PCM + English).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What are the main routes for private engineering college admissions in Karnataka?</strong><br>
            (1) KCET (state students only); (2) COMEDK (all-India); (3) Management quota (direct to college, higher fees); some colleges/universities admit via their own entrance, but recent policy aligns all with govt exams.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Can non-Karnataka students get CSE at top colleges (RVCE, BMS, PES etc)?</strong><br>
            Yes, via COMEDK or management quota (not KCET).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What’s the difference among RVCE, RVU, and RVITM?</strong><br>
            RVCE: “Flagship”, oldest, VTU-autonomous, all branches, top placements. RVU: New, private university, mainly BTech (Hons) in CS, not VTU. RVITM: New, VTU (not autonomous), lower cutoff, separate faculty/placements.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Are placements and faculty shared across RVCE, RVU, RVITM?</strong><br>
            No, all independent; only occasional shared placement drives, but selection/final results are distinct.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How do KCET, COMEDK, and management quota fees compare?</strong><br>
            KCET (~₹1.2L/yr); COMEDK (~₹3L/yr); Management/JEE routes in private colleges: ₹4–5L/yr+.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>If I join via management/JEE and later secure KCET/COMEDK, is the excess fee refunded?</strong><br>
            Varies by college, but PES and RVCE allow excess fee adjustment/refund if moved to a lower-fee seat within deadlines.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is UNI-GAUGE and how does it differ from COMEDK?</strong><br>
            It’s an optional PAN-India score (including some Karnataka private univs). Same exam, separate rank. Most use COMEDK, unless targeting UNI-GAUGE colleges.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Do Class 12 board marks affect COMEDK ranking?</strong><br>
            No—eligibility only; rank = entrance exam score only.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Do board marks affect KCET rank?</strong><br>
            Yes, KCET rank = 50% KCET + 50% PCM (board exam, any board).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Is BTech (Hons) from RVU equivalent to a BTech from a VTU college?</strong><br>
            BTech (Hons) means extra courses/credits; value in placements/higher education largely depends on brand/alumni network and individual accomplishments, not degree title per se.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the COMEDK exam structure?</strong><br>
            180 MCQs (Phy 60, Chem 60, Math 60), 3 hours, no negative marking.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How do I apply for management quota at RVCE, BMS, PES?</strong><br>
            Directly via college; applications open early, seats/fees vary, must meet minimum eligibility.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Which colleges participate in COMEDK counseling?</strong><br>
            Most top Karnataka private engineering colleges (e.g. RVCE, BMSCE, MSRIT, BNMIT, NHCE, CMRIT, RVITM, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Can I write both KCET and COMEDK?</strong><br>
            Yes, and it’s common to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How does the seat allocation/counseling process work?</strong><br>
            After results, branch/college preferences are entered online; seat allotted on rank/preference; multiple rounds occur.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How do I check KCET/COMEDK seat cutoffs?</strong><br>
            On official COMEDK and KEA websites every year; look up last admitted rank by branch/college.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>If I take COMEDK + UNI-GAUGE, is it two exams or one?</strong><br>
            One exam, two ranks, if you register for both.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>BE vs BTech—any practical difference?</strong><br>
            For jobs/PG, little to no difference; BTech may be a bit more practical/applied, but overlap is huge.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Can I switch from COMEDK/management seat to KCET if I get a better allotment later?</strong><br>
            Policies differ; most good colleges (PES, RVCE) allow it with fee adjustment (within deadlines).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>When does COMEDK application open?</strong><br>
            Usually February; exam is typically in May.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Is there a domicile quota under COMEDK?</strong><br>
            No; open to all.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How are COMEDK counseling rounds structured?</strong><br>
            Multiple rounds—initial, surrendered/vacant seat rounds, each with new cutoffs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What are the refund rules if withdrawing after taking a COMEDK seat?</strong><br>
            Usually UGC rules (e.g., ₹10k deduction pre-2nd round), but college-specific policies prevail—read offer terms carefully.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Is COMEDK exam pattern and level different from UNI-GAUGE?</strong><br>
            No, they’re identical if you select both.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Is COMEDK easier/harder than KCET/JEE?</strong><br>
            Slightly easier than JEE Main; on par or a bit tougher than KCET; speed is crucial.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Can NRIs/OCIs apply for COMEDK?</strong><br>
            Yes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Do all private Karnataka engineering colleges accept COMEDK?</strong><br>
            Nearly all do, but always check the year’s official list; some (like PES University) are exceptions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Can international school students apply to COMEDK?</strong><br>
            Yes, as long as +2 PCM and English requirements (and minimum marks) are met.
