        <h1>COMEDK Engineering Admissions ‚Äì Extensive FAQ</h1>
        <p><em>Based on in-group chat discussions only ‚Ä¢ Last updated Jan 2025</em></p>
        <div class="question">What is COMEDK and how is it different from KCET?</div>
        <div class="answer">COMEDK is an all-India entrance test (no domicile restriction) for private engineering colleges in Karnataka; KCET is for Karnataka residents only (7 years of study in Karnataka, with 10th or 12th there). KCET rank = 50% board PCM marks + 50% KCET exam; COMEDK uses only exam performance for ranking. Fees: KCET ~‚Çπ1.2L/yr; COMEDK ~‚Çπ3L/yr.</div>
        <div class="question">Who can apply for COMEDK?</div>
        <div class="answer">Anyone with Indian nationality, including NRI/OCI, who has passed (or is appearing in) 12th grade (PCM + English).</div>
        <div class="question">What are the main routes for private engineering college admissions in Karnataka?</div>
        <div class="answer">(1) KCET (state students only); (2) COMEDK (all-India); (3) Management quota (direct to college, higher fees); some colleges/universities admit via their own entrance, but recent policy aligns all with govt exams.</div>
        <div class="question">Can non-Karnataka students get CSE seats at top colleges (RVCE, BMS, PES, etc.)?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, via COMEDK or management quota (not KCET).</div>
        <div class="question">What's the difference among RVCE, RVU, and RVITM?</div>
        <div class="answer">RVCE: "Flagship", oldest, VTU-autonomous, all branches, top placements. RVU: New, private university, mainly BTech (Hons) in CS, not VTU. RVITM: New, VTU (not autonomous), lower cutoff, separate faculty/placements.</div>
        <div class="question">Are placements and faculty shared across RVCE, RVU, RVITM?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, all independent; only occasional shared placement drives, but selection/final results are distinct.</div>
        <div class="question">How do KCET, COMEDK, and management quota fees compare?</div>
        <div class="answer">KCET (~‚Çπ1.2L/yr); COMEDK (~‚Çπ3L/yr); Management/JEE routes in private colleges: ‚Çπ4‚Äì5L/yr+.</div>
        <div class="question">If I join via management/JEE and later secure KCET/COMEDK, is the excess fee refunded?</div>
        <div class="answer">Varies by college, but PES and RVCE allow excess fee adjustment/refund if moved to a lower-fee seat within deadlines.</div>
        <div class="question">What is UNI-GAUGE and how does it differ from COMEDK?</div>
        <div class="answer">It's an optional PAN-India score (including some Karnataka private univs). Same exam, separate rank. Most use COMEDK, unless targeting UNI-GAUGE colleges.</div>
        <div class="question">Do Class 12 board marks affect COMEDK ranking?</div>
        <div class="answer">No‚Äîeligibility only; rank = entrance exam score only.</div>
        <div class="question">Do board marks affect KCET rank?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, KCET rank = 50% KCET + 50% PCM (board exam, any board).</div>
        <div class="question">Is BTech (Hons) from RVU equivalent to a BTech from a VTU college?</div>
        <div class="answer">BTech (Hons) means extra courses/credits; value in placements/higher education largely depends on brand/alumni network and individual accomplishments, not degree title per se.</div>
        <div class="question">What is the COMEDK exam structure?</div>
        <div class="answer">180 MCQs (Phy 60, Chem 60, Math 60), 3 hours, no negative marking.</div>
        <div class="question">How do I apply for management quota at RVCE, BMS, PES?</div>
        <div class="answer">Directly via college; applications open early, seats/fees vary, must meet minimum eligibility.</div>
        <div class="question">Which colleges participate in COMEDK counseling?</div>
        <div class="answer">Most top Karnataka private engineering colleges (e.g. RVCE, BMSCE, MSRIT, BNMIT, NHCE, CMRIT, RVITM, etc.).</div>
        <div class="question">Can I write both KCET and COMEDK?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, and it's common to do so.</div>
        <div class="question">How does seat allocation/counseling work?</div>
        <div class="answer">After results, branch/college preferences are entered online; seat allotted on rank/preference; multiple rounds occur.</div>
        <div class="question">How to check KCET/COMEDK cutoffs?</div>
        <div class="answer">On official COMEDK and KEA websites every year; look up last admitted rank by branch/college.</div>
        <div class="question">If I take COMEDK + UNI-GAUGE, is it one or two exams?</div>
        <div class="answer">One exam, two ranks, if you register for both.</div>
        <div class="question">BE vs BTech ‚Äì practical difference?</div>
        <div class="answer">For jobs/PG, little to no difference; BTech may be a bit more practical/applied, but overlap is huge.</div>
        <div class="question">Can I switch from COMEDK/management seat to KCET if I get better allotment later?</div>
        <div class="answer">Policies differ; most good colleges (PES, RVCE) allow it with fee adjustment (within deadlines).</div>
        <div class="question">When does COMEDK application open?</div>
        <div class="answer">Usually February; exam is typically in May.</div>
        <div class="question">Is there domicile quota under COMEDK?</div>
        <div class="answer">No; open to all.</div>
        <div class="question">How are COMEDK counseling rounds structured?</div>
        <div class="answer">Multiple rounds‚Äîinitial, surrendered/vacant seat rounds, each with new cutoffs.</div>
        <div class="question">What are refund rules if withdrawing after COMEDK seat?</div>
        <div class="answer">Usually UGC rules (e.g., ‚Çπ10k deduction pre-2nd round), but college-specific policies prevail‚Äîread offer terms carefully.</div>
        <div class="question">Is COMEDK exam pattern level different from UNI-GAUGE?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, they're identical if you select both.</div>
        <div class="question">COMEDK difficulty vs KCET/JEE?</div>
        <div class="answer">Slightly easier than JEE Main; on par or a bit tougher than KCET; speed is crucial.</div>
        <div class="question">Can NRIs/OCI apply for COMEDK?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes.</div>
        <div class="question">Do all private colleges accept COMEDK?</div>
        <div class="answer">Nearly all do, but always check the year's official list; some (like PES University) are exceptions.</div>
        <div class="question">Can international school students apply to COMEDK?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, as long as +2 PCM and English requirements (and minimum marks) are met.</div>
